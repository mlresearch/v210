title: Intention Estimation via Gaze for Robot Guidance in Hierarchical Tasks
abstract: To provide effective guidance to a human agent performing hierarchical tasks,
  a robot must determine the level at which to provide guidance. This relies on estimating
  the agent’s intention at each level of the hierarchy. Unfortunately, observations
  of task-related movements only provide direct information about intention at the
  lowest level. In addition, lower level tasks may be shared. The resulting ambiguity
  impairs timely estimation of higher level intent. This can be resolved by incorporating
  observations of secondary behaviors like gaze. We propose a probabilistic framework
  enabling robot guidance in hierarchical tasks via intention estimation from observations
  of both task-related movements and eye gaze. Experiments with a virtual humanoid
  robot demonstrate that gaze is a very powerful cue that largely compensates for
  simplifying assumptions made in modelling task-related movements, enabling a robot
  controlled by our framework to nearly match the performance of a human wizard. We
  examine the effect of gaze in improving both the precision and timeliness of guidance
  cue generation, finding that while both improve with gaze, improvements in timeliness
  are more significant. Our results suggest that gaze observations are critical in
  achieving natural and fluid human-robot collaboration, which may enable human agents
  to undertake significantly more complex tasks and perform them more safely and effectively,
  than possible without guidance.
